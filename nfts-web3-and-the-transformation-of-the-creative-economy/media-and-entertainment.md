# Media and Entertainment
Since their inception, moving pictures have captivated audiences, providing them with a unique ability to experience stories. The allure of cinema and television lies in their extraordinary ability to teleport viewers into distinct realms, stir emotions, and immerse them in riveting tales. Through the masterful fusion of cinematography, storytelling, performance, and sound, these mediums succeed in curating an immersive and transformative experience that wholly engages its audience.

Cinema and television have morphed into a universal dialect, seamlessly surmounting barriers to provide an expansive platform for a kaleidoscope of voices and stories to be echoed across the globe. These mediums champion empathy, stimulate social awareness, and provoke societal norms, thereby fostering an environment conducive to cultural dialogue and comprehension. They possess profound cultural influence, mirroring and molding our societal values, beliefs, and aspirations. Their capacity to simultaneously entertain, educate, and inspire presents a powerful trio, offering a sanctuary for escape, empathy, and exploration of diverse perspectives. They ignite discussions, confront norms, and forge shared experiences that unify individuals from an array of backgrounds.

The film and television industry wield an immense economic influence, generating an impressive revenue stream and creating myriad job opportunities that bolster economic growth and development. The media's significance has triggered an exponential rise in spending. For instance, Morgan Stanley revealed that the global expenditure for TV and filmed entertainment content reached a staggering $150 billion in 2022. Another estimate by Ampere Analysis suggested content expenditure could be as colossal as $230 billion. Moreover, the industry likely generates even more extensive ancillary economic benefits beyond direct content spend.

The pivotal role stories play in sculpting cultural attitudes and consumer behavior also amplifies the global influence of films and television shows on various ancillary economic activities. These mediums stimulate tourism, inspire advertising, fuel merchandise sales, and forge licensing agreements, crafting opportunities for ancillary industries such as catering, equipment rentals, and post-production services. An all-encompassing study by OlsbergSPI in 2019 estimated the total economic impact of the screen sector at an astounding $414 billion.

Despite the importance and value of film and TV, the businesses within the entertainment industry are experiencing a period of enormous disruption. Streamers, studios and key creative talent alike all dislike the new market dynamics and are looking for alternatives that can offer a better distribution of risk and reward within the industry. Web3 technologies offer the opportunity to reinvent traditional content creation business models centered around cultivating a core fan base and investing in multi-purpose virtual assets that can be used in virtual production, games and metaverse experiences. In so doing, integrating NFTs and web3 into entertainment franchises promises to supercharge fan engagement, enable greater ownership for key creative talent and dramatically reduce risk for content buyers. 

In order to understand the value proposition of Film3 let’s first examine the problems entertainment businesses are currently facing. 

The Shifting Nature of Entertainment
The entertainment landscape today would be almost unrecognizable just 15 years ago. 15 years ago, the vast majority of consumers got their content through Pay-TV, TV box subscriptions that were extraordinarily difficult to cancel. Consumers were essentially content takers, watching whatever content was playing on their favorite channels. 

This setup allowed cable providers to bundle channels together, forcing customers to pay for a wide array of channels they never watched. Over time the price of Pay TV rose substantially faster than inflation as cable providers bundled ever more channels that viewers didn’t watch into their subscriptions. 

However, this move up market meant that many consumers were paying substantially more than they wanted to for a “better” product that far outstripped their needs. This created a vacuum at the lower end of the market for an innovative competitor to cater to price conscious consumers. 

This is exactly what Netflix did when it launched its streaming service in 2008 for just $8 a month (compared to the $80 cable TV providers were charging). In an effort to increase their divisions margins and earn higher bonuses, executives at all the major entertainment studios licensed their library content to Netflix, allowing Netflix to build a huge user base on the strength of external IP like Friends, the Office and NCIS. 



As Netflix gained more users and financial firepower they slowly moved up market and began producing original content like House of Cards. Simultaneously, Netflix focused relentlessly on improving the consumer experience offer customers instant on-demand access to a massive library of content from any device at premium quality. 

Slowly entertainment incumbents began to wake up to the danger posed by Netflix. Finally, around 2018, the erosion of their core Pay TV business forced the entertainment companies like Disney, Warner Bros., and Paramount to pivot and try to emulate Netflix’s business model. This was the beginning of the Streaming Wars which saw these massive entertainment of conglomerates invest tens of billions into building out their streaming platforms and securing a massive array of expensive original content to debut on their platforms. 

However, the entertainment industry has proven structurally less profitable than the Pay-TV business. Worse, the entrance of so many new platforms into the streaming market has shifted customer behavior undermining the business models of streaming platforms. 

During the excesses of the bull market of 2020 and 2021, Wall Street was laser focused on the the holy grail of subscriber growth. Companies who exceeded consensus expectations of quarterly subscriber growth were rewarded with soaring stock prices while businesses that underperformed new subscriber expectations were punished. As a result, entertainment conglomerates incurred huge losses trying to reach scale and onboard more subscribers. 

However, as inflation and interest rates began to rise and stock prices suffered, investors began to turn their attention back to the profitability of the companies’ operations. It soon became apparent that the streaming market was not as lucrative as many executives and investors had at first hoped. This became abundantly clear in mid-2022 when Netflix reported its first quarterly subscriber loss in a decade, wiping out $55 billion in shareholder value and causing a massive fall in the stock prices of other streamers. 

It is now clear that competition among streaming platforms has increased costs and dramatically increased subscriber churn, dramatically worsening unit economics. All the major streamers are scaling back or holding constant their content budgets while they focus on reducing their operating losses. Yet with the exception of Netflix and Disney (as well as Apple and Amazon, who can afford to treat their entertainment offerings as loss leaders for their ecosystems) all the major streaming platforms are subscale and losing billions of dollars on operations. In 2022, the four largest traditional media companies, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount and Comcast (NBCU), collectively lost $10 billion on their streaming efforts. Paramount and NBCU expect these losses to accelerate in 2023.

It turns out that faced with more subscription options, many consumers actively manage their entertainment expenditure and cycle between subscriptions, depending on the content currently available on different platforms. These serial churners create a huge problem for the streamers business models as Doug Shapiro eloquently describes in his Medium article “To Everything, Churn, Churn, Churn.” 

Market data now indicates that streaming households subscribe to an average of around 4 streaming platforms. There are currently 8 or so major streamers. In such an environment it is unclear when or even if many of these existing streamers will ever achieve profitability. 


Studios and content creators are also unhappy with the current market dynamics. Broadly the entertainment industry faces a couple main problems that are very difficult to solve from within the entertainment industry that make it ripe for disruption. 


Leveraging web3 technologies has become a game-changer for creators and independent production studios, revolutionizing the way content is incubated, financed, and engaged with. With web3, creators are empowered to incubate content from a diverse range of cultures more efficiently, at a reduced cost, and with fewer resources.

\


One of the significant challenges faced by filmmakers and content creators in the traditional entertainment industry is the lack of a direct relationship with their audience. The long value chain and traditional IP development process have made it difficult for creators to obtain audience feedback, solicit support, and build a dedicated fanbase. However, web3 changes this landscape by providing creators with a platform to foster vibrant communities, secure funding for their intellectual property development, and offer their audience a financial stake in the success of the project.

\


Web3 technology allows content studios and creators to raise capital through NFT sales or security tokens, providing an alternative and decentralized funding model. By tokenizing their IP, creators can engage with the audience early on and obtain valuable feedback during the development stage. This enables them to refine their content based on the community's preferences and interests, ensuring a stronger connection between the creators and their fanbase.

\


Moreover, the concept of NFTs strengthens brand loyalty by creating a sense of ownership and emotional attachment among collectors. Through NFTs, holders become investors in the entertainment franchise they love, giving them the opportunity to participate in the development process, provide feedback, and see their ideas incorporated into the IP universe. This interactive and fulfilling experience builds a dedicated and engaged fanbase that can serve as advocates, generating word-of-mouth marketing and strengthening the negotiating position of the creators with studios and streaming platforms.

\


Web3 also helps reduce costs and risks by securitizing backend participation. By offering key talent backend participation through blockchain technology, creators can align incentives and share the financial rewards, making the overall production process more cost-effective and efficient.

\


This new approach to incubating content in the web3 ecosystem provides creators with valuable market feedback, builds a dedicated fanbase early on, and reduces financial risk. It also maximizes the potential upside by showcasing the strength of the IP and the core audience base when pitching to studios and streaming platforms. The success of projects such as Claynosaurz, Pudgy Penguins, and the Fracture demonstrates the potential of web3 in transforming the entertainment industry, fostering inclusivity, interactivity, and economic empowerment for creators and their audience alike.

Building Audience-Centric Entertainment Franchises

In today's entertainment landscape, audiences are playing an increasingly important role in the success of entertainment franchises. With the advent of social media and the rise of viral reactions and memes, audiences have the power to make or break a franchise. People are drawn to these franchises because everyone is talking about them—at school, at work, and online—and they want to understand and be part of the community.

\


Take the example of "Squid Game," "Stranger Things," and "Game of Thrones" (specifically, seasons 1 to 7). These franchises have all experienced immense popularity and viral success, drawing in audiences who may not have ordinarily been interested in their respective genres. Through viral discussions and word-of-mouth recommendations, these shows have become cultural phenomena, capturing the attention and curiosity of viewers worldwide.

\


"Squid Game," a South Korean survival drama series, gained global attention through social media buzz and viral marketing. Its unique concept, intense competition, and thought-provoking social commentary resonated with audiences. The show's viral success drew people in, transcending language and cultural barriers, as they wanted to be part of the shared experience and join the conversations happening online and offline.

\


Similarly, "Stranger Things" tapped into nostalgia for 1980s pop culture and blended it with compelling storytelling and memorable characters. The show's ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia while appealing to a broad range of audiences made it a must-watch series. Its viral success can be attributed to social media discussions, viral marketing campaigns, and the desire to be part of the collective experience surrounding the show.

\


"Game of Thrones" also experienced widespread popularity, particularly in its early seasons. Seasons 1 to 7 garnered a devoted fan base that eagerly followed the political intrigues, epic battles, and shocking twists within the world of Westeros. The series became a cultural phenomenon, discussed not only among avid fantasy fans but also among casual viewers who were drawn in by the hype and buzz surrounding the show. The viral discussions, debates, and memes surrounding "Game of Thrones" created a sense of community and shared experience, compelling people to tune in and be part of the phenomenon.

\


In this era of audience-first entertainment franchises, NFTs offer a unique opportunity to strengthen the relationship between creators and their fanbase. Through NFTs, fans can become actual investors in the future of their favorite franchises, aligning their incentives with the success of the franchise. This inherently makes more sense than fans of traditional entertainment franchises behaving like investors with no real stake in the franchise. The ownership of NFTs allows fans to feel a sense of ownership and participation, driving their motivation to contribute positively to the franchise's growth.

\


Furthermore, NFTs enable creators to engage with their fanbase on a deeper level. By leveraging NFTs, creators can solicit feedback from the community, involve fans in the development process, and incorporate their ideas and input into the franchise. This interactive and inclusive approach fosters a stronger sense of community and empowers fans to become active participants in shaping the future of the franchise.

\


Moreover, the viral nature of these entertainment franchises becomes amplified through NFTs. As fans proudly display their digital collectibles and participate in the ownership of NFTs, they generate further interest and curiosity among their peers. This word-of-mouth promotion, coupled with the viral nature of social media, helps spread awareness and attract new viewers to the franchise. The NFTs serve as badges of belonging and create a sense of exclusivity, encouraging fans to share their enthusiasm and passion with others.

\


In conclusion, the integration of NFTs into the entertainment industry has the potential to revolutionize the relationship between entertainment franchises and their fanbase. By allowing fans to become investors and active participants, NFTs create a stronger bond and alignment of incentives. The viral nature of entertainment franchises, fueled by social media and viral reactions, can be further amplified through NFTs, attracting new audiences and fostering a vibrant and engaged community around the franchise.

Coherent Multi-media Franchises

The entertainment landscape is undergoing a significant shift, with the boundaries between different forms of entertainment, such as movies, TV shows, and games, becoming increasingly blurred. In this new environment, it is crucial for entertainment franchises to approach their development with a more deliberate and careful strategy, focusing on building a strong foundation for each pillar of the franchise.

\


Traditionally, the approach to franchise expansion has been characterized as "Trickle-Down Transmedia." After a successful movie, studios would quickly capitalize on its profitability by producing sequels. This often led to a decline in the quality of storytelling and plot compared to the original film. Additionally, when it came to video games, animated series, and TV shows, which were often outsourced, there was a sense of disconnection from the original IP. Examples of this include Jaws, Terminator, Ghostbusters, Alien and Jurassic Park to name a few. This approach diluted the value of the franchise and alienated fans.

\


However, in today's platform-neutral world, where audiences consume various forms of entertainment on the same devices, a coordinated effort is needed to leverage the convergence of these mediums. The most successful franchises, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, have embraced a spherical storytelling approach that synergizes their different platforms, creating a cohesive and immersive experience for fans.

\


Nevertheless, even successful franchises like Marvel have faced challenges when trying to meet the demand for new content, resulting in a decline in quality in certain installments. This highlights the importance of taking a thoughtful and deliberate approach to creating the next generation of multimedia franchises.

\


To succeed in this evolving landscape, entertainment franchises must prioritize foresight, strategic planning, and careful execution. By building each pillar of the franchise with intention and ensuring a cohesive and high-quality experience across different platforms, creators can engage and captivate audiences, fostering long-term success and creating a lasting impact in the ever-changing entertainment industry.

\


NFTs and web3 communities are poised to play a pivotal role in the design of synergistic and coherent multimedia franchises, particularly within the fantasy and science fiction genres. This emerging approach holds great significance for streaming platforms, as blockbuster, platform-defining TV shows and movies have become increasingly vital in attracting and retaining users.

\


Notably, shows like Game of Thrones and Stranger Things played instrumental roles in the success of HBO and Netflix, respectively. These series became must-have subscriptions, differentiating the streaming platforms from others in the market. Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe and The Mandalorian have been integral to the triumph of Disney+. Recognizing the significance of such franchises, competing streaming platforms, including Apple, Amazon, and Paramount Plus, have invested heavily in projects like Foundation, The Rings of Power, The Wheel of Time, and Halo.

\


The significance of these shows is underscored by Jeff Bezos' statement, "I want my Game of Thrones," which has influenced Amazon's substantial investments in The Rings of Power and The Wheel of Time. Roy Price, the former head of Amazon Studios, emphasized the impact of these blockbuster shows, noting that big shows are essential in moving the needle and inspiring others in the industry. He compared the impact of Game of Thrones to that of Jaws and Star Wars in the movie industry, stating that it serves as a model for a hit.

\


In this landscape, exceptional shows that generate buzz and capture public attention are the true focus for streaming platforms. The competition lies not in broad acceptance but in delivering exceptional content. Franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, and Game of Thrones exemplify the immense value these expansive universes, high-quality plots, and compelling characters can bring to studios.

\


While the complexity of certain science fiction and fantasy stories has hindered their adaptation to the big screen, recent advancements in generative AI offer promising solutions. These advancements have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of content creation, particularly for high-budget productions with extensive virtual special effects. As a result, producing exceptional science fiction and fantasy content becomes more viable and valuable.

\


The content incubation approach described earlier is uniquely suited to bring these entertainment franchises to life. A producer or studio could acquire the film rights to a captivating science fiction or fantasy book and leverage it to develop a collection of 10,000 NFTs. By selling these NFTs, they can raise significant funds, such as $1.5 million, while simultaneously building a dedicated community around the IP. These funds can be invested in developing essential components of a Hollywood pitch package, such as scripts, bibles, and loglines. Moreover, decentralized IP concepts can be integrated, allowing NFT holders to compete and contribute to script improvement in exchange for rewards, recognition, and incremental ownership of the IP. Additionally, allocating resources to create iconic buildings, places, and landscapes from the books further immerses holders in the fictional world.

\


Successful implementation of this approach would result in a large and passionate community united around the IP. This community-driven support strengthens studios' positions when pitching projects to streamers, as it offers an expansive universe with potential for follow-on TV shows and movies, backed by an existing core audience base. Ultimately, the convergence of NFTs, web3 communities, and the content incubation model presents an exciting opportunity to revolutionize the way multimedia franchises are designed, developed, and embraced by audiences in the modern entertainment landscape.

Media and the Metaverse

Media franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones have the potential to become exponentially more valuable in the context of the metaverse for several reasons.

\


Firstly, these franchises have already established massive and dedicated fan bases around the world. These fans have a deep emotional connection to the characters, stories, and worlds created within these franchises. As the metaverse aims to provide immersive and interactive experiences, leveraging the existing fan base of these franchises can drive significant engagement and participation within their respective metaverses. This built-in fan base ensures a ready and enthusiastic audience, making the metaverse more vibrant and exciting.

\


Secondly, these franchises possess expansive and well-developed universes that offer a wealth of content, characters, and storylines. This richness provides a solid foundation for creating diverse and immersive metaverses. The metaverse can bring these universes to life in ways that extend beyond traditional media formats, allowing fans to explore, interact, and engage with their favorite characters, settings, and narratives. The metaverse can offer unique experiences and opportunities for fans to be a part of these beloved franchises, enhancing their value and appeal.

\


Moreover, the metaverse's ability to blend virtual and real-world elements opens up new avenues for monetization and ownership. Fans can own and trade virtual assets tied to these franchises, such as collectibles, virtual real estate, or even virtual representations of iconic characters. This ownership aspect adds a new layer of value and engagement to the metaverse experience, as fans can express their fandom, showcase their assets, and participate in a thriving virtual economy.

\


Furthermore, the metaverse's potential as a collection of microverses allows for specialized and tailored experiences centered around specific entertainment franchises. A Marvel metaverse, for example, can immerse fans in a world filled with superheroes, epic battles, and interconnected storylines. Similarly, a Game of Thrones metaverse can offer fans a chance to explore the intricate politics, rich history, and iconic locations of Westeros. This focus on specific franchises ensures that each microverse provides an authentic and engaging experience for fans, catering to their unique interests and passions.

\


In summary, media franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones bring immense value to the metaverse due to their dedicated fan bases, rich universes, and potential for interactive and immersive experiences. Their inclusion in the metaverse ensures a captivating and dynamic environment that attracts and engages fans, making the overall metaverse experience far more compelling. These franchises contribute to the metaverse's appeal and help create a diverse collection of microverses, each offering unique and exciting opportunities for fans to explore and own assets within their favorite entertainment worlds.

\


Incorporating NFTs from the beginning is instrumental in developing entertainment franchises into metaversal brands and offers significant upside in a cost-plus dominated industry.

\


By maintaining the metaverse and gaming rights for the stories we develop, we unlock the potential of successful franchises beyond traditional TV shows or movies. Profits generated from these media can be reinvested into expanding the corresponding virtual worlds, enhancing their immersive potential and creating a seamless integration between the narrative-driven content and the interactive metaverse experience.

\


The initial funding for franchise development can come from digital collectible (NFT) holders. These early supporters can receive airdropped tokens, enabling them to participate in bidding for in-game assets and locations. This unique model allows holders to benefit financially without transforming NFTs into securities, providing them with an opportunity to engage with the metaverse while also enjoying potential financial returns.

\


Integrating NFTs and Web3 communities from the outset simplifies the process of adapting intellectual property for a story-driven metaverse experience. The inherent liquidity and programmability of NFTs make it easier to create dynamic and malleable virtual realities, where real people can actively participate and shape the narrative landscape.

\


This approach not only breathes new life into established IPs but also transforms them from static creations into living, evolving virtual worlds that engage users on multiple levels. The future of metaverses holds the potential for seamless transitions between different franchise-based realms, allowing users to traverse between Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Star Wars, and more, creating a unified metaverse experience.

\


Overall, this methodology offers a powerful means to bootstrap metaverse and entertainment franchises through crowdfunding and NFTs, mitigating financial risks and unlocking asymmetric upside potential. It establishes a symbiotic relationship between the franchise creators, the passionate fanbase, and the evolving metaverse landscape, ensuring continued innovation, engagement, and value creation for all stakeholders involved.
